Hybrid Self-Tuning Boyer-Moore NEWS       -*- outline -*-

* Version 0.13, 11 February 2015

** Hacks

  Earlier releases (Savannah task submission) were based on a
  private repository, and the tarball created via a release script
  was intact.  The tarball included a shiny new git repository.
  However, a few files were included correctly in the tarball, but
  an overenthusiastic .gitignore file meant that these files were
  silently omitted from the Git repository... this omission exposed
  when the repository was copied to the Savannah server with
  "git push".

  Having some essential files uncontrolled meant that Savannah's
  "You tag it, I'll tarball it" feature resulted in an incomplete
  set of sources.  So, the extra rules have been removed from
  .gitignore, the missing sources have been added, and a new version
  has been created and tagged.

** Bug Fixes

  Added Grouse Software copyright notices, in tandem with the FSF
  notices, as requested by the Savannah administrators in Task
  #13451 (Comment #8):

  https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?func=detailitem&item_id=13451

* Version 0.11, 25 January 2015

** Improvements

  Added dynamic Git version stamping (git describe ...) to the version
  number reported by --version; and

  Upgraded README to include some information on how to set up the
  Lua environment required by the regression test rig.

** Bug fixes

  Improved copyright and licensing marking, including adding notices
  to some files that were missing notices.

Initial release.

This program (hstbm) is an exploratory fork of GNU Grep, intended
to focus on only one of the half-dozen search capabilities in
GNU Grep (the Hybrid Tuned Boyer-Moore search, part of
src/kwset.c), and use a different algorithm (Self-Tuned
Boyer-Moore) that I invented in about 1998 and published in 2000,
updated to include the "Hybrid" memchr/memchr2 search options,
and otherwise striving to be sufficiently similar and fair to
GNU Grep that meaningful comparisons of performance can be made.

The regression test rig (the subdirectory tests/, and especially
the Lua scripts regression.rig and PosixExec.lua) are not derived
from GNU Grep, and are licensed in line with the permissive MIT
license used by the Lua project and many Lua-associated projects:
           MIT licensed
           Copyright (C) 2014-2015
           by Grouse Software.
           Written by behoffski.

All other files, being based in part or whole on GNU Grep as an
"exploratory fork" as mentioned above, are very heavily based on
work owned by the Free Software Foundation Inc., and carry an FSF
copyright notice accordingly.  In a few places, there has been
some effort to reformat the code, sometimes in an effort to
refactor and/or modularise the code.  The copyright in these
changes is owned by Grouse Software.
