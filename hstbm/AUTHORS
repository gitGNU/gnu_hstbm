Most of this code is derived from GNU Grep, with significant
sections filtered through and/or reinterpreted by behoffski.
Therefore, FSF copyrights are applied to all the sources.

I (behoffski) invented a tweak to the Tuned Boyer-Moore
string search algorithm in April 1998, and have wanted to
incorporate the algorithm into GNU Grep for a long time.  After
trying a bottom-up "untangle" process to try and facilitate
lexing and parsing tools that provide information for good
search algorithm selection, this program is instead a "top-down"
approach that is, roughly (from the outside), a program that
acts like fgrep much of the time, but has some character class
support (including named classes and equivalence classes).

The authors of GNU Grep, partially listed in the original
AUTHORS file, some named in the ChangeLog, and more recently
detailed in the Git logs, have probably contributed 98% of
the code that I've based my work on here.

The regression test rig is a curious hybrid of shell scripts
and Lua framework; its initial coverage is very weak, and
some of the more exotic tests may be harder to accommodate in
Lua than in Bash or sh, but it shows some promise.
