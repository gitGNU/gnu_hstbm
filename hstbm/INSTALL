Hybrid Self-Tuning Boyer-Moore (hstbm)

Installation notes:

Do NOT install: Not production-strength code.

No installation procedure defined at this stage, as the program
is a demonstration/prototype entity, and is expected to only be
used via local invocation (e.g. ./h or src/h) in its current
embryonic state.

Many search patterns deliberately cause an assertion because
while any worthwhile Grep program should support them, the B-M
algorithm is not suited to performing the search, and hstbm
deliberately focuses exclusively on high-performance B-M code.

The program does this to emphasise the experimental/prototype
nature of the hstbm code, and to reduce the chances of false
comparisons being made because of semantically different
searches.
