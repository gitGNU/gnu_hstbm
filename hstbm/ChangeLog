	Version 0.12
	* Added Grouse Software copyright notices, as per request from
	  Savannah managers.

	hstbm isn't an official GNU project, and so the recommended
	initial copyright profile is to acknowledge both GNU Grep as the
	base for forked code (FSF copyright), with the presentation here
	also acknowledging copyright by Grouse Software.

	See Savannah Task #13451 for the discussion that led to this
	change, especially Comment #8:
	https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?func=detailitem&item_id=13451

	Version 0.11
	* Revised Savannah submission, following feedback.

	Copyright notices have been added or clarified in many of the
	files under the hstbm/ tree, including:
	- bootstrap, po/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am,
	  README, tests/*

	The program version reported by --version now incorporates
	source tree commits/revision/dirty information provided by
	"git describe", just as GNU Grep does; the code is derived from
	Grep's build-aux/git-version-gen, but writes a C include file
	(src/.git_current_version.h) that is used by src/main.c.
	If Git isn't installed, a default is provided, naming the base
	release number, plus a "[source state uncertain]" disclaimer.
	See src/Makefile.am, src/.update_git_current_version and
	src/main.c for implementation details.

	README now includes more guidance on how to install the
	Lua-related dependencies; these are needed for the test rig.

	Some Autotools-generated configuration files, namely
	*/Makefile.in, have been removed, as they are unnecessary and
	possibly incorrect for some platforms.
